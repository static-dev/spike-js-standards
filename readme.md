[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/static-dev/spike-js-standards.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a super simple wrapper for a basic webpack2 babel configuration. It's `babel-preset-env` without es module parsing (webpack does this), and a plugin for supporting `import()` which is a ecma standard, and webpack uses for dynamic code splitting.
